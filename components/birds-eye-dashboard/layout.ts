/** The dashboard's editable layout: which panels render, which table columns show.
 *
 *  Three sources, in precedence order:
 *  1. A live `layout` override — the studio's dashboard editor passes the
 *     review's config directly so toggles apply instantly, without waiting for
 *     the manifest step to re-run.
 *  2. A v2 manifest (`layout_version >= 2`): strict gating on `panels_rendered`,
 *     which also carries the honest skip-reasons for panels whose data is
 *     missing.
 *  3. A legacy manifest (or none): the pre-editor behavior — only the three
 *     historically-gated charts (and prisma, which never rendered) consult the
 *     manifest; everything else is always-on. An old bundle therefore renders
 *     exactly as it always did.
